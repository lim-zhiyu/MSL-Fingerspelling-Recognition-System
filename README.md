# Malaysian Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition System

## About
This Malaysian Sign Language (*Bahasa Isharat Malaysia*) Fingerspelling Recognition System is created as part of my university's capstone project. It can recognize the hand signs for all letters from A to Z and numbers from 1 to 10. 

The program is written in Python, Google's MediaPipe is used for hand recognition and tracking, and OpenCV is used for processing video frames in real-time.

## How to Run
Note: a Windows PC with a webcam is required to run the program. The program has not been tested on other environments.

1. Download and install Anaconda Navigator.
2. In Anaconda Navigator, import the environment file (environment.yml) from this project and switch to it.
3. Open Powershell Prompt in Anaconda Navigator and navigate to the project directory (where app.py is located).
4. Run the command "Python .\app.py" (without quotes) then visit the url displayed in the output with a browser.
5. To stop the webcam and close the web app, press Ctrl + Pause Break in Powershell Prompt or close Powershell Prompt.
